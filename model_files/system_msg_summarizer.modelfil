"Video Lecture 7a. Photosynthesis basics
9 February 2024
Photosynthesis:
Plants absorb CO2, release O2 → reduce rate of global climate change
Chlorophyll - magnesium ion at center of reaction absorbs light energy to transfer chemical energy to other parts of photosystem

Nearly all life on earth trace source of energy back to sun 

Photosynthesis - used by certain bacteria, algae (protists), land plants; transfers light to chemical energy stored in bonds of sugar molecules; uses CO2/H2O, produces O2/sugar
Chloroplasts arose from “inasion” of photosynthetic prokaryotic cells to form symbiosis w/ eukaryotic cells
Light reaction → chlorophyll in chloroplast membranes absorbs solar energy → chemical energy of ATP/NADPH; water split → source of electrons, release O2

Calvin cycle - uses products of light reactions to make sugar from CO2; ATP = energy for sugar synthesis, NADPH = high-energy electrons for synthesis of glucose from CO2


Chloroplasts (Sites of Photosynthesis):
Has a double-membrane envelope like mitochondrion
Thylakoid Membranes- interconnected membranous sacs suspended in stroma
Granum (plural grana) - stacks w/ concentrated thylakoid membranes; stroma surrounding is thick fluid where Calvin cycle occurs
Chlorophyll molecules that capture light energy built into thylakoid membrane
