# AIHackathon

## Problem:
- Students have giant workloads and often *feel* like they have no time to study
    - Many juggle several responsibilities alongside school
        - Work, extracurriculars, familial obligations, and also require time to relax
        - Many studies [insert reference] encourage students to spend at least 2 hours a day studying 
  
-  Studying takes 10–13 hours/week


## Solution:
- With AI, students can visualize and interact with their notes in a new dimension
- Our product takes an active learning approach, allowing students to engage with their notes
    - Summarizing notes --> decrease clutter, focus solely on important/key points
    - Create quizzes/flashcards
    - Suggestions for better note-taking
        - Retrieval augmented
        - Identifies holes in student's knowledge base
- Uses Ngrok to help students host locally 


## Deliverables: 
  - Software
      - Front-end aspect (UI)
      - Handwriting recognition
      - Notes summarization
      - Self-hosting tool (if time allows) 
  - Video
      - Presentation
      - Skit
      - 

## Ethics:
  - it's not cheating if it's only using students' notes
  - simply a tool to speed up learning process
  - does not generate new information/content/etc.
  - price aspect -> doesn't generate new info so it's cheap computationally
  - can be hosted locally (self-hosting!)
  - open source!
